# CEF Browser Embedding Implementation

This branch contains the complete CEF implementation that replaces PyQt WebEngine for true browser embedding within application panels.

## Key Features:
- CEF browsers embed within designated panel areas (no separate windows)
- All 4 AI services auto-activate immediately on startup
- Python 3.12 compatible using cef-capi-py
- Windowless rendering mode for proper panel embedding

## Usage:
```bash
python startup_embedded.py
```

All browsers will auto-start and embed within their designated panels immediately.
